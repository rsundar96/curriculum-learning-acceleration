# Curriculum Learning Acceleration

Aim is to investigate whether Curriculum Learning helps speed up the generalisation of Deep Neural Networks. Code used to obtain the results as given in my Master's Thesis is present here, along with instructions on how to execute the code. Structure of the repository is as follows:

**Keras Curriculum Learning**: Keras code used to replicate the results as detailed in [On The Power of Curriculum Learning in Training Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03626.pdf).
